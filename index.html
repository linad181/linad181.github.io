                    <br/>
                    
                    <p>My name is Frank Pecka, I was born in Moses Lake, WA and I am 22 years old (soon to be 23). Currently I&#39;m a student at Eastern Washington University and have decided to major in Visual Communication Design. I haven&#39;t fully decided what kind of career I would like after graduation, I&#39;m pretty sure that it will settle on some type of Web Design path however.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>I have a moderate amount of experience creating HTML and CSS code, but a minimal amount of design experience. However, that is what I hope to learn more of through my schooling.</p>

                    <h3>Computer Skills</h3>

                    <p>Computers have always been a passion of mine, I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m very familiar with the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of working with/on both Windows and Mac OS X. As well as how to troubleshoot.</p>

                    <h3>Web Programming</h3>

                    <p>I learned the basics of HTML and CSS back during my senior year of high school. Unfortunately I&#39;ve never really had the opportunity to utilize those skills in a public fashion, I have tried to keep them up to date and dust them off from time to time.</p>
